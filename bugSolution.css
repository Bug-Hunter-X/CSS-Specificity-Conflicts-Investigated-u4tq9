The solution involves carefully understanding CSS selector specificity:

1. **Specificity order:** ID selectors are most specific, followed by class selectors, then element selectors.
2. **Combined selectors:** When selectors are combined (e.g., `div.class1`), their specificity is additive.
3. **!important:** Avoid using `!important` unless absolutely necessary, as it compromises the predictability of the CSS cascade.

To fix the style conflict in the example, ensure the selectors are correctly ordered and specified according to their relative specificity. For example, if you want `div.class1` to always override `div` and `.class1`, make sure that `div.class1` is declared *after* the other rules, and that there is no rule with an `id` selector in between that might override these styles. It is best practice to target elements as specifically as possible in your styles to avoid the unexpected cascade behavior.  If specificity alone is insufficient, you may have to refactor CSS into more specific and well-organized sections. Using a CSS preprocessor might help to manage this complexity.
