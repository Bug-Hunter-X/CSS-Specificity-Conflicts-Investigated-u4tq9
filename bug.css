The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.class1, .class2 {
  color: red;
}

#id1 {
  color: green;
}

div.class1 {
  color: yellow;
}
```

The problem lies in understanding how the browser resolves conflicting styles. While the `div` selector applies to all `div` elements, `div.class1` has higher specificity because of the class selector.  The order doesn't matter in this case, the most specific selector always wins.

If an element has `id1`, `class1` and is also a `div`, `#id1` will take precedence due to the id selector's highest specificity.

This bug becomes difficult to diagnose because it's not an obvious syntax or runtime error; rather, it is a misconception about the CSS cascade and specificity rules.
